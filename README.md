# Welcome! 

This is a small test app for demonstrating some of the basic principles of Django authentication. It allows testing of the following functions:

- User Login
- User Logout
- User Registration
- User Profiles
- Password Resets

Password reset emails are logged to the console.

This repo is part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module for CodeInstitute. It's been extended to use Django 2.0.6 and has been named `auth_with_django` to prevent confusion with builtin Django auth stuff.
